                    The training center contributes to serving various sectors of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiques and
                    the museumsâ€™ staff. This is through providing training courses that aim to enhance their environments
                    and raising the efficiency of the workers inside and outside the museum; in terms of education and
                    archaeological awareness. That in return contributes to the upgrading of their social, cultural, and
                    economic awareness to meet the standards of international museums.
