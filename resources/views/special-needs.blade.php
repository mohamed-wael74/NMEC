                    Aiming at enhancing the societal role of NMEC in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS), NMEC is
                    providing several means of accessibility for individuals with special needs. Special entries and
                    passages have been created and managed for the convenience of those with mobility disabilities so as to
                    facilitate their visit and ensure a smooth journey in NMECâ€™s complex. In addition, the educational
                    department at NMEC has prepared specific workshops for individuals with special needs in order to
                    sharpen their talents and maximize their joy during their visit at NMEC.
